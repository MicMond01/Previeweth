## My process

The first step was to make the markup with html followed by css styling.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

```html
<span>I never knew span was capable of flowing along image easily</span>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
  -ms-transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I want to strengthen my CSS skill (the use of grid and flexbox most importantly).


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/tryit.asp?filename=tryhow_css_image_overlay_icon) - This helped me for the image hover. I really liked this styling and will use it going forward.

- [Example resource 2](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/5-ways-to-center-a-div-using-css-fcd790524708) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
